//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

//for each bhi use kar sakhtay hai or for loop
// /n new line mai chanay kai liya use hota hai
let petAnimals = ["cat","dog","rabbit","pappy","parrot"]

//using loop
for (let onePet of petAnimals){
    console.log(`A ${onePet} would make a great pet.`)
}

//print a message outside of loop
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!")
