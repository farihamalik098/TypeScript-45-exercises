//Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//â€¢ If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
var userNames = ["fahad", "ali", "zeeshan", "adeel", "Admin"];
userNames.forEach(function (oneUser) {
    if (oneUser === "Admin") {
        console.log("hello ".concat(oneUser, ", would you like to see a status report?"));
    }
    else {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(oneUser, ", thank you for logging in again"));
    }
});
